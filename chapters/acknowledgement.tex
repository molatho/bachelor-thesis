\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
At this moment of accomplishment I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Thomas Ihme, for the guidance, encouragement and advices he has provided throughout my work on this thesis.\\
This thesis and my studies in computer science would not have been possible without the love and support of my family. I am forever thankful to my parents for enabling me to take the opportunities and make the experiences that made me who I am today. Further, I want to thank my sister Tracy Joan Rosenstein who proof-read this thesis and thereby encouraged me to write it in English.\\
I would like to express my gratitude to my fellow student Patrick Eisenschmidt who has been extraordinarily encouraging and supportive by providing feedback, proof-reading this thesis and regularly taking time to engage in long discussions with me.\\ \\
Lastly, I owe thanks to a very special person, my fiancée Marie-Darline Mroß for her continuous and unfailing love, support and understanding during our common past and studies in computer science. I deeply appreciate her belief in me, her ongoing encouragement and her being there when I need her.
